A web application for technical job-seekers that provides study material for missing job requirements and tracks application progress. 

Once a user has uploaded a resume and saved jobs to their job board, .apply(me) scrapes and compares both sources to create a list of required job skills that are missing from the user's resume. Once the data is composed, .apply(me) looks to make the user smarter by reaching out over the web and retreiving prominent text and video resources to level up the their skill.
